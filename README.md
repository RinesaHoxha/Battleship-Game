Battleship AI is an interactive game where players compete against a computer to win in the classic game of Battleship. Utilizing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, the computer makes strategic moves based on the current state of the game. Designed to work with a standard 10x10 Battleship board, our program is versatile and can scale to accommodate different board sizes.
